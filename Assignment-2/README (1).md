# Sampling Assignment

## Objective
To analyze the effect of different sampling techniques on machine learning models using an imbalanced credit card dataset.

## Dataset
Credit card transaction dataset with imbalanced classes.

## Sampling Techniques
- Simple Random Sampling  
- Stratified Sampling  
- Cluster Sampling  
- K-Fold Cross Validation  
- Bootstrap Sampling  

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (M1)  
- Decision Tree (M2)  
- Random Forest (M3)  
- Support Vector Machine (M4)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (M5)  

## Evaluation Metric
Accuracy

## Summary
Different sampling techniques affect model performance differently.  
No single sampling method performs best for all models.
