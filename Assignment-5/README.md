# Text Generation Model Selection using TOPSIS

## Overview
This project applies the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method to select the best pre-trained text generation model based on multiple evaluation criteria.

## Domain
News Article Text Generation

## Models Evaluated
- GPT-2
- GPT-Neo
- T5
- BART-Large
- XLNet

## Evaluation Criteria
- Perplexity (Minimize)
- BLEU Score (Maximize)
- ROUGE Score (Maximize)
- Inference Time (Minimize)
- Model Size (Minimize)
- Human Evaluation Score (Maximize)

## Result
BART-Large is identified as the best pre-trained model for text generation using the TOPSIS approach.
